## Introduction

This repository is an attempt to better learn functional C# and do the 
[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) problems at the same time.

## What is functional to me?

I'm not sure exactly what functional programming is or what is the
proper definition but I set the following rules for myself, mostly taken
from the book [Functional Programming with C#](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/functional-programming-with/9781492097068/)
and with some personal additions:

1. Don't use `if`, `for`, `while`, etc. Ternary operator `?` is allowed
2. Try to use readonly data structures and records as much as possible
3. LINQ is considered functional, so any use of LINQ is allowed
